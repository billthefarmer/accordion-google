# Accordion #
Accordion emulation written in C. Uses PC keyboard and space bar
to emulate a three row button accordion. There is a choice of
midi instruments and keys, now including C System and B System. A
Windows and a <a href='http://code.google.com/p/accordion/wiki/Mac'>Mac</a>
version have been released. Now including bass. The 12 bass
buttons play uni-sonic bass notes for B/C/C#, C System and B
System.

## Playing ##
Hold the keyboard facing away from you with the Esc button at the
top. Play the keys, waggling the space bar as it were the
bellows. The escape key, the control key and the alt key may also
be used as the bellows. If you don't know how to play button
accordion, see http://info.melodeon.net.
