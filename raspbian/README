                              Accordion
                              =========

Three row accordion emulator with bass. Uses the standard keyboard
keys as accordion buttons, the function keys as bass buttons, and the
space bar as the bellows. The Esc, Shift, Ctrl and Alt keys may also
be used as the bellows. Unfortunately, depending on your luck, the
keyboard on your machine may not detect more than two or three buttons
pressed at once. I found an old keyboard worked much better. You can
see what is going on in the bottom half of the accordion window, which
shows what keys the program thinks are pressed.

Dependancies
============

Accordion uses ALSA, Sonivox, and Gtk+, so you need libasound2,
libmidi, libsonivox, and libgtk2.0-0. If you are running a Debian-like
system, like Raspbian, you can get these with the shell command 'sudo
apt-get install libasound2 libgtk2.0-0'. Libmidi and libsonivox are
included.

Controls
========

There are two drop down controls, two toggle buttons, a volume
control, and a button in the top half of the window. The instruments
drop down lets you choose what midi instrument you would like to
attempt to play. The reverse button check box lets you play
widdershins. The key drop down lets you choose a key to play in. There
is a choice of F/Bb/Eb, G/C/F, A/D/G, C#/D/G, B/C/C#, C System and B
System. The key defaults to A/D/G. More kays can be added by popular
request, or you can hack the program yourself. The Notes button shows
notes on the key buttons. I have removed the '#' and 'b' symbols
because they make the buttons resize themselves. The volume control
lets you change the volume. The volume defaults to maximum. The quit
button lets you give up, or you can click on the window close icon.

Playing
=======

Hold the keyboard in a vertical position, with the escape key at the
top. Adjust the reverse check box according to which hand you want to
use. Press the keys as if they were accordion buttons, and press the
space bar to emulate waggling the bellows. If you don't know how to
play button accordion see http://info.melodeon.net

Building
========

You have a choice: If you have a Debian/Rasbian system, you should be
able to just type 'make'. The dependancies are: libasound2-dev and
libgtk2.0-dev, so if you haven't got them installed, you can type
'sudo apt-get install libasound2-dev libgtk2.0-dev'. This will install
loads of other stuff as well. If you want the full monty with error
messages buried in pages of gnubabble, or your system is completely
different, type './configure', 'make' and 'make install' if
successful. See INSTALL for the official instructions. This will
overwrite the nice simple Makefile, but there is a cunning backup in
Makefile.de. Obviously autoconf doesn't understand German.
